###README FILE for Number Baseball app###

The goal of the game is to correctly guess the 4 digit number in as few guesses as you can.

The app will generate a random 4 digit number that does not have any repeating digits. Avalilable numbers are 0-9 (0 is acceptable for the first digit).

After each guess, the app will return hints to help you for your next guess.

Hints work as follows:
You get a "strike" for each guess that has the correct number with the correct position.
You get a "ball" for each guess that has the correct number with an incorrect position.

Example:
The actual number is 1234.
You guess 1428.
The app should respond with:
	1 strike
	2 balls
